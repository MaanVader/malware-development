# Part 1: developing a keylogger
## Description:
In the folder called `keylogger` I have developed a simple python keylogger named `roheen.py`. This keylogger will generate a `.txt` file in the current folder once called. For data exfiltration purpose a discord bot called `bot.py` has been created to exfiltrate data from a victims pc to ours. Finnaly a script `main.py` acts as the main function that should be run in order to run the keylogger and the discord bot which acts as the `c2` server at the same time.
